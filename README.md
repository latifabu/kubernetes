### Kubernetes
### What is Kubernetes
- Kubernetes, also known as K8s, It is known as a container orchestration tool
- It is an an open-source system for automating deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications
- It's responsible for allocating and scheduling containers and providing then with abstracted functionality.
- Responsible for health checks, file storage
- In summary k8 is about controlling how, when and where containers are run.
- 
### The benefits
- Keeps a check on the health of the nodes and containers.
- Requires less resources
- Automated rollouts and rollback
- Auto Scaling, horizontal scaling: scales application up and down quickly either manually or automatically
- Self Healing - A containerized application or component will automatically be redeployed in its intended state whenever a failure occurs.
- Storage orchestration - Kubernetes allows users to automatically mount a storage system of choice, such as local storage, public cloud providers, and more. You still need to provide the underlying storage system.
- Automatic bin packing - Kubernetes places containers automatically based on the required resources and other restrictions without impairing availability. Automated rollouts and rollbacks: Kubernetes distributes changes to the software or the configuration using a rollout.
